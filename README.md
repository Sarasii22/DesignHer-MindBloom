# DesignHer-MindBloom
Health &amp; Wellness Website for Girls 

- Why I Selected This Topic
    MindBloom is designed to empower girls students by providing a supportive digital platform to prioritize their mental health and wellness. I chose this topic because mental health is a critical yet often overlooked aspect of student life, particularly for young women who face unique challenges. By creating a safe space for mood tracking, journaling, and meditation, MindBloom aims to foster emotional resilience, self-awareness, and balance, helping girls thrive academically and personally.


- Technologies Used
  Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js
  Charting: Chart.js (for mood tracking visualization)
  Storage: LocalStorage or Firebase (for persisting mood data and journal entries)
  Deployment: Vercel (for hosting the web app)
